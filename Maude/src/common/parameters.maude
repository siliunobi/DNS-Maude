  --- TsuNAME-like behavior when faced with circular dependencies:
  --- When enabled, the resolver falls back to the parent zone when a "non-trivial" circular dependency is detected,
  --- rather than falling back to SBELT. This leads to TsuNAME-like behavior where the parent zone is queried
  --- repeatedly until the work budget is exceeded.
